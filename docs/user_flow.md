### Example of the user flow

A simplified example of setting the goal in the app would be:

1. The user logs in successfully.
2. From the Dashboard page, the user clicks on the Profile menu.
3. From the menu, the user navigates towards the My Goals page.
4. On the page, the user can view her current Goals.
5. By clicking on Update your goals, she is then sent to the Goals update page.
6. Now, she will set her goals by providing relevant information.
7. Finally, she sees the confirmation message.

Above mentioned example of a user flow is called a 'happy path,' which means a simplified version of the user flow has a
successful response.
