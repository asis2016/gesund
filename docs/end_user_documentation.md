## User flow

User flow is used for describing the process of interaction between a user and the website. The following image presents
the 'flow' from the Gesund App entry point until the final action, i.e., Logging out.

### Example of the user flow

A simplified example of setting the goal in the app would be:

1. The user logs in successfully.
2. From the Dashboard page, the user clicks on the Profile menu.
3. From the menu, the user navigates towards the My Goals page.
4. On the page, the user can view her current Goals.
5. By clicking on Update your goals, she is then sent to the Goals update page.
6. Now, she will set her goals by providing relevant information.
7. Finally, she sees the confirmation message.

Above mentioned example of a user flow is called a 'happy path,' which means a simplified version of the user flow has a
successful response.

## Sitemap

<p>
A sitemap is a collection of pages on a website. In a simple form, it is a map of the website. Draw.io was used to
create the visual sitemap of the Gesund app.
