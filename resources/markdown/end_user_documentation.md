**Instruction on using a `steps` `feature`**

or **Deleting** a resource.

- By clicking number **1**, the user can add their steps.

  the [ListView](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/class-based-views/generic-display/) page (**4**).
- **5** - The user gets successful notification and they are [rewarded by the system](#).
- **6** - To update existing steps record.
