<h1>Privacy policy</h1>

<h2>I. General</h2>
<p>
    We take the protection of your personal data very seriously and treat it confidentially and in accordance with the
    statutory data protection regulations as well as this privacy policy. This privacy policy applies to the web
    application called “Gesund App” (<a href="https://gesund.amaharjan.online">https://gesund.amaharjan.online</a>)
    (hereinafter "APP"). It explains the nature,
    purpose, and scope of data collection in the context of APP use. We point out that data transmission on the Internet
    can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.
</p>

<h3>Function of the app</h3>
<p>
    The APP was developed as part of a master thesis project titled "Introducing Gamification to overcome employee's
    health-related risks in work from home (WfH) settings" at the University of Koblenz-Landau. It offers the following
    functionalities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on various “apps” within the APP.</li>
    <li>A dashboard page view with individual performance and statistics.</li>
    <li>A history page view on the user's history.</li>
    <li>An "export my data" functionality to export one's data.</li>
    <li>Presentation of the ranking list amongst users (users are anonymized in the list).</li>
    <li>Presentation of one's Experience Points (XPs).</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The data is stored on a server hosted in USA. The APP operates on MySQL database within the same APP server. The
    data connection between the device and the server is secured using state-of-the-art SSL encryption.
</p>

<h3>Responsible party </h3>
<p>
    The responsible party for data processing within the scope of this APP is:
</p>
<p>
    Ashish Singh Maharjan <br>
    University Strasse 1, 56070 Koblenz <br>
    E-mail: info@gesund.amaharjan.online
</p>
<p>
    "Responsible entity" is the entity that collects, processes or uses personal data (e.g., names, e-mail addresses,
    etc.).
</p>

<h3>Personal Data</h3>
<p>
    Personal data is information that can be used to discover your identity. Information that is not associated with
    your identity (such as number of users of the APP or anonymized behavioral data of users in the APP) is not
    included.
</p>
<p>
    The personal information we collect may include the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Full name</li>
    <li>Email address</li>

</ul>

<h3>Sensitive Information</h3>
<p>
    We process the following categories of sensitive information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Health data, only in the form of weight (kg), i.e., for calculation of user’s Body mass index (BMI).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any
    changes to such personal information.
</p>
<p>
    The processing of this personal data is necessary to ensure the functionality of the APP. The legal basis for this
    data processing is our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO, your consent within the
    meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. a DSGVO and/or - if a contract has been concluded - the fulfillment of our contractual
    obligations (Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO).
</p>

<h3>General storage period of personal data</h3>
<p>
    Unless otherwise stated or specified within this privacy policy, the personal data collected by this APP will be
    stored until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to store it, or the purpose for storing the data no
    longer applies. If there is a legal obligation to store the data or another legally recognized reason for storing
    the data (e.g., legitimate interest), the relevant personal data will not be deleted until the respective reason for
    storing the data no longer applies.
</p>

<h3>Legal basis for the storage of personal data</h3>
<p>
    The processing of personal data is only permitted if there is an effective legal basis for processing this data. If
    we process your data, this is regularly done on the basis of your consent in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a
    DSGVO (e.g., when you voluntarily provide your data in the registration mask or as part of the contact form). The
    relevant legal basis in each case will be specified separately in the context of this privacy policy, if applicable.
</p>

<h3>Encryption</h3>
<p>
    This APP uses encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as
    requests that you send to us as the APP operator or communication between APP users. This encryption prevents the
    data you transmit from being read by unauthorized third parties.
</p>

<h3>Changes to this privacy policy</h3>
<p>
    We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time in compliance with legal requirements.
</p>

<h2>II. Your rights</h2>
<p>
    The GDPR grants certain rights to data subjects whose personal data is processed by us, which we would like to
    inform you about at this point:
</p>

<h3>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>
<p>
    Many data processing operations are only possible with your consent. We will explicitly obtain this from you before
    starting data processing. You can revoke this consent at any time. For this purpose, an informal communication by
    e-mail to us is sufficient. The legality of the data processing operations carried out until the revocation remains
    unaffected by the revocation.
</p>

<h3>Right of complaint to a supervisory authority </h3>
<p>
    In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have a right of appeal to a supervisory authority. The right
    of appeal is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.
</p>

<h3>Information, deletion and correction </h3>
<p>
    You have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, their origin and recipient and
    the purpose of data processing, as well as a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well
    as for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time at the address given in the
    imprint.
</p>

<h3>Right to restriction of processing </h3>
<p>
    You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. To do this, you can contact
    us at any time at the address given in the imprint. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following
    cases:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the
        duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the processing of your personal data has happened / is happening unlawfully, you can request the restriction
        of data processing instead of deletion.
    </li>
    <li>
        If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you have
        the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of erasure.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a balancing of your and our interests must be
        carried out. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request
        the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may - apart from being stored - only be
        processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of
        the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the European
        Union or a Member State.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Right to data portability </h3>
<p>
    You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in performance of a
    contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct
    transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.
</p>

    processing is our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO, your consent within the meaning
    of Art. 6 (1) lit. a DSGVO and/or - if a contract has been concluded - the fulfillment of our contractual
    obligations (Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO).
</p>
